    """
    Counterfactual-style advisor that prompts users to reflect on what would follow if the given statement were falseâ€”assuming all provided evidence is still accurate.

    The prompt should:
    1. Pose the possibility that the statement is not true and an opposing alternative which is then true.
    2. Elaborate on the implications of this alternative being true based on the provided evidence.
    3. Asking subtle, reflective questions about whether this counterfactual version aligns or conflicts with the evidenceâ€”not through obvious contradictions, but through nuanced tensions, inconsistencies, or missing links.

    The prompt encourages users to reason through implications that quietly challenge or reinforce the original statement, guiding them toward a form of proof by contradiction.
    Don't make it long, keep it concise and focused on the implications of the counterfactual, no more than a paragraph.
